            9. TERM OF SERVICES
        </p>
        <p>
            9.1 &nbsp;Subject to the provisions below, Weclip shall continue to provide you the Service for as long as you 
            are entitled to receive them pursuant to the Third Party Terms. You are aware that unless you terminate the
             Services according to the Third Party Terms, such terms (and the payment obligations therefor) may provide 
             that the Services, and payment therefor, may "roll-over" for additional terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            9.2 &nbsp;Weclip may, in its sole discretion and at any time, terminate these Terms and stop providing the Service 
            without liability, including if:
        </p>
        <p>
            9.2.1 &nbsp;you have breached any provision of the Terms or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do 
            not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms; or
        </p>
        <p>
            9.2.2 &nbsp;Weclip is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Service to you is, or 
            becomes, unlawful); or
        </p>
        <p>
            9.2.3 &nbsp;Weclip is discontinuing the Service to users in the country in which you are resident or from which 
            you use the Service; or
        </p>
        <p>
            9.2.4 &nbsp;the provision of the Service to you by Weclip is, in Weclip’ opinion, no longer commercially viable.
        </p>
